Driver Drowsiness Detection System is a real-time computer vision project using Python, OpenCV, and Dlib. It monitors driver alertness through webcam video by detecting facial landmarks and calculating Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR). The system identifies eye closure to detect drowsiness and provides alerts to prevent fatigue-related accidents.
